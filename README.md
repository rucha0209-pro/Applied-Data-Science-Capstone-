The restaurants Battle of Neighbourhood in Warsaw
Warsaw is a county (powiat), and is further divided into 18 districts (dzielnica [ˈd͡ziɛlnit͡sa]), each one with its own administrative body. The word dzielnica is also used informally in Polish to refer to any distinct part of a town or city.

The current division was introduced in 1990 and revised by Warsaw City Council in 2002. The names of the 18 districts are now as follows: Bemowo, Białołęka, Bielany, Mokotów, Ochota, Praga Południe, Praga Północ, Rembertów, Śródmieście, Targówek, Ursus, Ursynów, Wawer, Wesoła, Wilanów, Włochy, Wola, and Żoliborz.

Nowadays it has a greater attraction to international students. We want students to feel like home away from home from having a taste of their homeland.

Thus, the goal I want to reach with this exercise is to give a simple recommendation to students in Warsaw: in which district of the city will you find a large number or even concentration of which types of restaurants? Where to eat Mediterranean food, where to find Indian food, where to get fast food? The target audience are foreign Students.

## Data Description
I will, as requested by the assignment task, use foursquare data about restaurants in Warsaw. Foursquare is a US tech company from New York focusing on location data. Their technology and data powers apps such as Apple's Maps, Uber, Twitter and many other household names. Here is an example of a vegetarian restaurant in Warsaw on foursquare: https://de.foursquare.com/v/sattgr%C3%BCn/5c33306cc824ae002c2b414c.

I will use foursquare data such as the restaurant name, ID, location and category of food (vegetarian, Italian etc.).

Also, I will use the overview of districts/city parts of Warsaw from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Warsaw.
I will use these districts and the data about restaurants in these districts from foursquare to show the density of restaurants in them.
