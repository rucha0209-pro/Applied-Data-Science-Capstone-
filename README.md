## Business Problem
Ohio is divided into 16 congressional districts, each represented by a member of the United States House of Representatives. After the 2010 Census, Ohio lost two House seats due to slow population growth compared to the national average,[2] and a new map was signed into law on September 26, 2011.

This map was ruled unconstitutional due to "partisan gerrymandering", and state Republicans were told to redraw the map before June 14, 2019.[3] However, on October 7, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the challenge to the map, allowing it to stay in effect for the 2020 election.[4]



Nowadays it has a greater attraction to international students. We want students to feel like home away from home from having a taste of their homeland.

Thus, the goal I want to reach with this exercise is to give a simple recommendation to students in Ohio: in which district of the city will you find a large number or even concentration of which types of restaurants? Where to eat Mediterranean food, where to find Indian food, where to get fast food? The target audience are foreign Students.

## Data Description
I will, as requested by the assignment task, use foursquare data about restaurants in Ohio. Foursquare is a US tech company from New York focusing on location data. Their technology and data powers apps such as Apple's Maps, Uber, Twitter and many other household names. Here is an example of a vegetarian restaurant in Ohio on foursquare: https://de.foursquare.com/v/sattgr%C3%BCn/5c33306cc824ae002c2b414c.

I will use foursquare data such as the restaurant name, ID, location and category of food (vegetarian, Italian etc.).

Also, I will use the overview of districts/city parts of Ohio from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio%27s_congressional_districts
I will use these districts and the data about restaurants in these districts from foursquare to show the density of restaurants in them.
