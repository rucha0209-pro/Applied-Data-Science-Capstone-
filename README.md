## Business Problem
Cologne, the city the author lives in, attracts a large number of tourists, not least due to its famous cathedral, the trade fairs and conventions, such as the gamescom, and its vibrant party scene. 
For tourists, finding the right place to eat can be a challenge, though. German dishes include a lot of meat, often pork, which many people do not want to eat for health-related, religious, cultural or moral reasons. This is just one motive for giving tourists a good overview about what to eat where.

Thus, the goal I want to reach with this exercise is to give a simple recommendation to tourists in Cologne: in which district of the city will you find a large number or even concentration of which types of restaurants? Where to eat Mediterranean food, where to find German food, where to get fast food? The target audience are foreign tourists.


## Data Description
I will, as requested by the assignment task, use foursquare data about restaurants in Cologne. Foursquare is a US tech company from New York focusing on location data. Their technology and data powers apps such as Apple's Maps, Uber, Twitter and many other household names. 

Here is an example of a vegetarian restaurant in Cologne on foursquare: https://de.foursquare.com/v/sattgr%C3%BCn/5c33306cc824ae002c2b414c. I will use foursquare data such as the restaurant name, ID, location and category of food (vegetarian, Italian etc.).

Also, I will use the overview of districts/city parts of Cologne from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Cologne
